## Simple system diagram

![Image](docs/simple-schema.jpg)

- Cards belong to a team, and may also belong to a user
- Transactions belong to a card and a team, and can be assigned to a user or another team
- Transactions belong to a BudgetCategory
- Some BudgetCategories have a special flag and are only for the FinOps team

## Gem wrapper

This project uses the [Investec Open Api gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/investec_open_api). 

# Transaction syncing

Transactions are synced in the [SyncTransactionsJob](app/jobs/sync_transactions_job.rb) and this is run automatically every 30 minutes via Sidekiq.

There is no ID defined by the Open API, and so one is constructed by using `transaction_date` (`date` field), the `description` and `amount` (with sign). Recent transactions are pulled, but these may include existing transactions that have already synced with the app. Transaction IDs that match are ignored.

This still may have clashes since the date field does not include a timestamp. Duplicate transactions are not handled by the app. 

# Slack notifications

Each team has a dedicated Slack channel.

When a new transaction is synced, a notification is sent to the assigned team's Slack channel via the [TransactionNotifier](app/services/transaction_notifier.rb). 

If a transaction belongs to a user's card, that person's name is part of the Slack message, and the message is still sent to the team channel.

# Autocategorization

When transactions are synced, similar transactions are checked. If any transaction exists with the exact same description and card, and the budget category is "Subscriptions" then the new transaction is automatically categorised to the "Subscriptions" budget category. 

No notification is sent for transactions if they are automatically categorised.
